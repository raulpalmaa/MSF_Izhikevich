# MSF_Izhikevich

The codes you will find here provide the main tools to apply the Master Stabiliy Function formalism to networks of Izhikevich neurons. 
Results on this topic can be found in the paper: Aristides et al. , Master stability functions of networks of Izhikevich neurons (2024).

## Master stability function formalism 101


## Lyapunov exponents of discontinous systems

The algorithm we used to evaluate the Lyapunov exponent related to the synchronous solution is the same used to calculate the LE of a isolated system.
For more information about it we recoomend the following paper: Bizzarri et al, Lyapunov exponents computation for hybrid neurons (2013).
