# MSF_Izhikevich

The material you will find here provides the main tools to apply the Master stability function (MSF) formalism to networks of Izhikevich neurons. 
Results on this topic can be found in the paper: [Aristides and Cerdeira , *Master stability functions of networks of Izhikevich neurons* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.044213).

## MSF review: 
A quick review of the mathematical formalism can be found at MSF_101.md

## Codes: 
- The Python code msf_izhikevich.py evaluates the Lyapunov exponents of the synchronous solution.
- The Python code net_izhikevich.py simulates a network of Izhikevich neurons and can return the synchronization error and the time series of the system.
