### Master Stability Function (MSF) Tools for Izhikevich Neuron Networks

Welcome! 
The material you will find here provides the main tools to apply the Master stability function (MSF) formalism to networks of Izhikevich neurons. 
This material is based on the methods and results presented in the paper: [Aristides and Cerdeira , *Master stability functions of networks of Izhikevich neurons* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.109.044213).
If you use this material or any part of it in your work, please cite this paper to give proper credit.

## MSF review: 
A quick review of the mathematical formalism can be found at msf_101.md

## Codes: 
- The Python code msf_izhikevich.py evaluates the Lyapunov exponents of the synchronous solution.
- The Python code net_izhikevich.py simulates a network of Izhikevich neurons and can return the synchronization error and the time series of the system.
